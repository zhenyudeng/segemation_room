优化前耗时，主要是合并地图花费太多时间

createVoronoiGraph take time0.008548
pruneVoronoiGraph take time0.043509
get critical_points2 take time0.003128
get critical_line take time0.005313
Found 6 rooms.
Find the Contours by critical_line take time0.000265
wavefrontRegionGrowing take time0.024987
collect neighbor IDs take time3.35404
mergeRoomPair take time5.7204
mergeRooms take time9.07446
seg take time9.16032



优化后

createVoronoiGraph take time0.00866
pruneVoronoiGraph take time0.043664
get critical_points2 take time0.003124
get critical_line take time0.00527
Found 6 rooms.

（1）统计这个区域的点的面积和统计相邻的区域花的时间太长，原因为使用全地图遍历统计。优化为找最大外接矩形后在最大外接矩形内统计区域内
